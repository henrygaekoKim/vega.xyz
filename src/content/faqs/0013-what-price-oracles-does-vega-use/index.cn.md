title: What price oracles does Vega use?
---

Currently, Vega supports <a href="https://github.com/compound-finance/open-oracle" target="_blank">Open Oracle</a> feeds or signed JSON messages for price data to settle a market. Most markets currently live are using the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/introducing-the-coinbase-price-oracle" target="_blank">Coinbase Price Oracles</a>. Efforts are currently underway to enable Ethereum price oracles, a pivotal development that will enable the Vega network to access a wide spectrum of data stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

To keep up to date and read more about this development work you can see the card on the engineering roadmap <a href="https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/114?pane=issue&itemId=2145913" target="_blank">here</a>, which includes a link to the full spec page.
