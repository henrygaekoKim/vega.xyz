Vega is an uncompromisingly decentralised derivatives DEX that runs on a purpose-built chain optimised for derivative trading. It allows for trading of derivative products with no gas fees and <a href="/key-concepts" >other features</a> that make it the preferred place for serious and retail derivative traders alike.

Several cash-settled futures markets <a href="https://console.vega.xyz/" target="_blank">are now live</a>, while spot and perpetual markets are currently being built for the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/114/views/4" target="_blank">Cosmic Elevator release of the protocol</a> and beyond.
