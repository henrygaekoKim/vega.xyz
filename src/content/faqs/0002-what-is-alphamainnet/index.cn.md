title: What is Alpha Mainnet?
---

Alpha Mainnet is the first mainnet release of Vega Protocol with trading enabled. It is an extended test phase of the protocol while key features are built out for the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/114/views/4" target="_blank">Cosmic Elevator release</a>, expected later in 2023.

Now that Alpha Mainnet is live:

- Traders can now trade, without paying gas fees, and deploy a wide variety of strategies on a decentralised DEX with a full on-chain limit orderbook (LOB)
- Market makers can allocate liquidity to existing markets in a live environment to kickstart trading and earn trading fees. Any network participant capable of market-making can contribute liquidity to existing markets, propose new markets, and earn rewards for doing so
- Validators continue to receive delegation from token holders and secure the network by running nodes. They also receive a share of the trading fees that accrue from trading on the markets that the community creates
- VEGA token stakers can continue to propose any market and discuss its creation through <a href="https://blog.vega.xyz/first-learn-about-vega-governance-then-free-the-markets-7ac9ec3adc13" target="_blank">on-chain governance</a>
