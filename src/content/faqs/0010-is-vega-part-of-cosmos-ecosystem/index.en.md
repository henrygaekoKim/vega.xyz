title: Is Vega part of the Cosmos ecosystem?
---

The Vega Protocol is an application-specific blockchain optimised for trading. It is a multi-year project to build and bootstrap <a href="/use">its own ecosystem</a>.

Although it is built using the <a href="https://cometbft.com/" href="_blank">CometBFT</a> (previously Tendermint) consensus layer, Vega does not use the Cosmos SDK or (currently) support IBC, so it is not integrated with the Cosmos ecosystem. Despite this, Vega ideologically aligns with Cosmos and the modular blockchain ecosystems and expects integrations to follow in time.
