title: Who runs Alpha Mainnet?
---

No one individual or entity runs Alpha Mainnet.

Decentralised validators, validate the network.

Data nodes, which provide APIs for using Vega’s Alpha Mainnet but don’t have any control over the network or produce blocks are run by validators and other community members (anyone may run a data node by following the steps linked <a href="https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/node-operators/get-started/setup-datanode" target="_blank">here</a>).

The project team’s role is to contribute to the development of the project.

Neither the project team nor any paid contributor to the Vega project runs any of the validators on the network. Nor do they control the bridge connecting the Ethereum blockchain to the Vega network. There are no admin keys or backdoors to either.

The only way the team can make changes is via the publicly available code. Validators and anyone else can inspect and suggest changes to the code. Validators may decide not to accept and deploy any change (in part or in full) and can fork the code or choose to deploy an unofficial release not made by the project team.

To see a full list of validators head to <a href="https://governance.vega.xyz/validators" target="_blank">this page</a> and to understand more about how the network is operated you can check out the docs <a href="https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/concepts/vega-chain/network" target="_blank">here</a>.
