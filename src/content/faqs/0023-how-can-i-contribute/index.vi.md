title: How can I make a change or contribute to the Vega Protocol?
---

To make changes to the live Vega network or a live market on the Vega network, you must go through the governance protocol outlined <a href="https://vega.xyz/governance/" target="_blank">here</a>, this allows anyone to suggest changes to be made through a governance proposal, which is then <a href="https://governance.vega.xyz/proposals" target="_blank">voted</a> on by <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xcb84d72e61e383767c4dfeb2d8ff7f4fb89abc6e" target="_blank">VEGA token</a> holders.

For direct protocol level or UI feedback, you can discuss that in GitHub discussions <a href="https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions" target="_blank">here</a>, or if you are particularly skilled you may open a PR on the public Vega repos listed <a href="https://github.com/vegaprotocol/" target="_blank">here</a>.
