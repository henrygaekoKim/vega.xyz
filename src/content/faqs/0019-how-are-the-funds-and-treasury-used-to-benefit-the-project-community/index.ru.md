title: How are the funds and treasury used to benefit the project community?
---

Most of the projectâ€™s funds go toward developing and testing the Vega software, and related activities like documentation. What is shared is published on the <a href="https://blog.vega.xyz/" target="_blank">blog</a> and can also be found in other FAQ answers.

Whilst there are currently no community-managed funds or treasury, this will likely change in some way once the <a href="https://github.com/vegaprotocol/roadmap/issues/61" target="_blank">on-chain governance features</a> to support it are delivered in October.
