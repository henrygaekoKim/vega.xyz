title: Is Vega part of the Ethereum ecosystem?
---

The Vega Protocol is an application-specific blockchain optimised for trading. It is a multi-year project to build and bootstrap <a href="/use">its own ecosystem</a>.

Nonetheless, Vega is adjacent to and collaborative with multiple other projects and their ecosystems, and all can be considered part of the larger “crypto” ecosystem. This includes oracle providers, token and stablecoin issuers, developers, trading firms and services.

Most significantly, Vega is connected to the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank">Ethereum network</a> and ecosystem via the <a href="via the Ethereum bridge" target="_blank">Ethereum bridge</a>, which currently supports the major EVM wallets. This means you can trade with supported Ethereum ERC-20 assets seamlessly on the Vega network.
