title: Is Vega Protocol a DAO?
---

Vega Protocol is not a DAO. The Vega network is decentralised and the source code is publicly viewable. It (the mainnet) exists through community token holders, validators, and liquidity providers independently participating in the network that has been built.

Contributors provided funds to Gobalsky Labs to build the software for the Network. The purpose of the entity is not to be a profit-making entity and as a consequence does not profit from the network. It doesnâ€™t stake tokens or receive income from the Vega network, including fees, or from conducting any other activities on chain.
