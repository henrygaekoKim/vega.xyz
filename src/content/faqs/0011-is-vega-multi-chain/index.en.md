title: Is Vega multi-chain?
---

The Vega Protocol is an application-specific blockchain optimised for trading.

At present, Vega is connected to and integrated with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank">Ethereum network</a> and ecosystem <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x23872549ce10b40e31d6577e0a920088b0e0666a#code" target="_blank">via the Ethereum bridge</a>, the first and currently only asset bridge.

However, Vega was always designed to be chain agnostic, allowing for collateral to be bridged over from other chains and then securely used to trade on Vega. This means that development work on connecting with other chains can take place if the community or team deem it strategically optimal. Current development prioritises making Vega feature complete for the 3 major feature deployments in 2023. Future development will likely involve Vega integrating with other networks, especially as others grow to compete with Ethereum for liquidity.
