title: What is Fairground Testnet?
---

Fairground is the official public testnet of Vega Protocol.

Releases from the roadmap are first tested internally and then publicly via Fairground incentives. These are time-sensitive network tests where the community helps to find bugs on the network and provide feedback on the latest features under development.

It also serves as a practice arena for individuals who wish to become familiar with Vega-related tasks. You can experiment with the UI/UX interface and scripts for executing various strategies.

Participate in incentives to earn rewards for helping to find bugs and battle harden Vega â€” <a href="https://fairground.wtf/" target="_blank">here</a>
