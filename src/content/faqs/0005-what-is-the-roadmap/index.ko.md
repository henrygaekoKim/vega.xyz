---

See the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/114/views/4" target="_blank">GitHub Roadmap</a>! This provides a view of the engineering teamâ€™s active development of feature sets that will likely eventually be deployed to mainnet if approved by the validators who secure the network.

Some features and incremental improvements, like small UX/UI changes, are not included here but are announced via the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Blog-Post-Vega-Alpha-Mainnet-FAQs-f530338ed70b425a9c6e0ba64b4ffadd?pvs=21" target="_blank">Tech Updates</a> and <a href="https://linktr.ee/vegaprotocol" target="_blank">Vega social channels</a>.
