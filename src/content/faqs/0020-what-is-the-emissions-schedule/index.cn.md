title: What is the emissions schedule now the vesting of the Coinlist sale has ended?
---

Overall Vega token emissions do not occur on an algorithmic emissions schedule controlled by the protocol. Instead, tokens are issued based on the needs and strategy of the project, which are not set in stone and are subject to change over time.

Detailed information about actual and currently planned emissions of all types is not currently published, however, information about the unlocking curve of vesting tokens can be found on the <a href="https://governance.vega.xyz/token/tranches" target="_blank">Governance site</a>, and more details about specific emissions curves such as for staking can be found on the Vega <a href="https://blog.vega.xyz/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
