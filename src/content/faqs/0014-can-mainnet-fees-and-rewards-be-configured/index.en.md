title: Can Mainnet fees and rewards be configured?
---

<a href="https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/concepts/trading-on-vega/fees-rewards" target="_blank">Fees and rewards are configurable</a> and can be <a href="https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/concepts/trading-on-vega/fees-rewards#funding-rewards" target="_blank">set up and funded</a> by anyone with a wallet on the Vega chain.

The Alpha Mainnet MVP release includes basic features for incentivising traders, market makers, and liquidity providers to begin bootstrapping the network so they can justify integrating their technology with Vega. These are somewhat configurable but also very limited.

Future releases will significantly improve the range and how configurable rewards and incentives are. This includes adding more rewards, different ways of dividing rewards between users, more configuration to rewards, team mechanics and gamification, the ability to use the on-chain treasury to allow some rewards to be entirely controlled through token holder governance, referral mechanics, volume discounts, and reward lockups/vesting, among other enhancements.

The first major upgrade to the current functionality is estimated to be deployed to mainnet in October.
