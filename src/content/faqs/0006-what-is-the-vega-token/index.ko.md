title: What is the VEGA token and how does it relate to Alpha Mainnet?
---

VEGA is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet that secures Vega’s proof of stake network. Unlike other Layer 1’s and decentralised derivative exchanges, VEGA is not used to transact on the network and trading does not incur gas. Trading fees are only incurred by price takers, incentivising more liquidity and market-making.

VEGA’s main functions on the Vega network are;

1. Secure the proof of stake Vega blockchain and the Vega<>Ethereum (ERC20) bridge
2. Make and vote on governance proposals to create and update markets, and manage the Vega protocol’s network parameters

Token holders benefit from rewards and a share of fee revenue if they stake and delegate their tokens.
