title: How do I get started with Alpha Mainnet?
---

The best way to get started with the Vega network is to first download and install a Vega wallet. There are (currently) 3 different types of Vega wallet:

- Recommended: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vega-wallet-mainnet/codfcglpplgmmlokgilfkpcjnmkbfiel" target="_blank">The browser wallet</a> — Vega’s newest and in active development browser extension wallet, a more user-friendly option
- <a href="https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegawallet-desktop" target="_blank">The desktop wallet</a> — a UI based local wallet application, stable and feature-complete
- <a href="https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/tools/vega-wallet/cli-wallet/latest/create-wallet" target="_blank">The CLI wallet</a> — command line based, experimental features and best suited for developers

Once your wallet of choice is downloaded and installed, you can head to <a href="http://console.vega.xyz/" target="_blank">console.vega.xyz</a> and access the IPFS instance of the Vega Trading Console. After connecting your Vega wallet, this will then allow you to connect a standard EVM wallet (like Metamask) and also to start depositing assets from Ethereum.
