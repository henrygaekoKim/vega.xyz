title: Is there a detection mechanism in place to detect wash trading?
---

The protocol prevents any key wash trading with itself and the fees associated with doing so dissuade this sort of behaviour. Nonetheless, on a pseudonymous network, it is impossible to prevent wash trading between multiple keys operated by the same participant because there is no information about traders other than their pseudonymous public keys.

Measures used on CEXs such as banning or restricting keys/traders as a result of manual reviews are impossible. It is also impossible for any trader to have special fee schedules, prioritised or privileged access to Vega, etc. (as also happens on many crypto CEXs) and all traders are subject to the same rules, which are transparent, as the full source code of the protocol is public. There are no admin keys or centralised control points.
